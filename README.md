# COVID-19 Daily Infections Prediction (Poland, 2020â€“2023)

This project focuses on predicting the **daily number of COVID-19 infections** in Poland between **2020 and 2023** using **time series analysis**.  
The model leverages both **Polish** and **international datasets** to improve forecasting accuracy.  
For the prediction, we used an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network, which is well-suited for time series data.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Time series forecasting of COVID-19 daily infections
- LSTM-based deep learning model
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Visualization of results and model evaluation
- Modular and scalable project structure

---

## ðŸ§  Model
We used an **LSTM** neural network implemented in **PyTorch**.  
LSTM was chosen because it captures long-term dependencies and temporal patterns effectively, which is crucial for time series forecasting.
